# Coverage audit

The former audit exposed recording-only assumptions, Boolean authentication,
missing lifecycle/protocol models and a vacuous subtitle-final assertion. The
registry now assigns every current command/event/lifecycle/protocol boundary to
an explicit contract, with actual source and evidence paths.

| Area | Formal contracts and implementation correspondence |
| --- | --- |
| Recording/output | Reservation, cancellation, four modes, finalization, consent, paste/restoration and disposed listeners; audio/finalize, useRecording/disposal and clipboard tests. |
| Capture/monitor | Native acceptance/fallback, worker/device identity, sample cap, detached workers and monitor generations; native tests, publication guard and disposed-effect regression. |
| Hotkeys | Three roles, conflict/backend partitions, hold/toggle, duplicates, session stops, queued starts and obsolete native/dispatch messages; per-gate owner, recording-lock bind, fresh mode gates and never-reused native IDs. |
| Engine/model management | Four engine classes, start/restart/failure, key slots/regions, downloads, busy exclusion, directory migration and frontend cancel/retry/unmount generations; engine/native/path, settings and download cancellation tests. |
| GPU idle unload | Startup/runtime enable windows, command-lock and active-stream exclusion, sticky readiness, reload and stale settings reads; two component models plus the integrated R2T2 workload. User-event tests cover blur/click ordering; CUDA speech probes check native unload/reload. |
| Authentication/providers | Browser/device/refresh/logout, partial storage, provider/key/endpoint pairing, captured authentication choices, one-session catalog credentials and storage/cache publication; coordinator/challenge/metadata/key interleaving tests, eight LLM/catalog snapshot paths and provider tests. |
| Settings/personalization | Version ordering, preference publication, providers/import/export, hotwords/corrections/app rules; profile/state/settings tests and unbounded Lean induction/first-match proofs. |
| Context/processing | Independent Off/On/Auto settings and app overrides, explicit operations/no-search, unknown fail-open, captured screenshots and meaning audit; Jev routing/task and context tests. |
| Assistant/selection | Cancellation/conversation/retry, search/source partitions, result ownership and exact-context replacement; production unit and overlay tests. |
| History | Multiple/shared records, consent, transactional deletion, retention/GC failures, export/leases/reprocessing; SQLite-backed tests and HistoryPage. |
| Windows/UI | Startup/tray/exit, manual/session generations, terminal subtitles, theme/autostart/navigation; window/overlay/tray/capability/system settings tests. |
| Protocols/transport | Tagged JSONL replies, native streaming, cloud result/error classes, SSE timeouts/retries/cancellation; Python server and Rust protocol/transport tests. |
| Updates/validation | Actual numeric version parser, HTTPS GitHub release URL and http(s) source/provider partitions; URL/input and normalization tests. |

## Bounds and decomposition

- Integrated workloads use one recording, up to two selection contexts and one
  settings change/engine switch each; components explore deeper interleavings.
- Most components use two sessions/requests/contexts. Hotkeys additionally use
  four registrations and a representative replacement/conflict sequence; all
  three event kinds pass through the common dispatcher in separate runs.
  The registration-epoch model uses two queued events, three epochs, one mode
  change and one shortcut replacement, with both native and dispatch queues.
  The setup-failure model explores successful setup, lifecycle failure and both
  restoration outcomes, including stale-gate/orphan-registration cleanup.
  Physical native IDs remain owned by queued cleanup until the backend drains
  them; this is eventual under scheduling fairness, not instant OS removal.
- History uses five rows, two audio identities, one lease and bounded retention.
  Shared rows and deletion during reprocessing are reachable cases.
- Runtime enumerates Qwen/R2T2/GLM/Alibaba, two regions/directories, two key saves,
  one download/input and bounded generations.
- Web search publication separates ownership, keyring I/O and cache publication
  for two save/load operations; zero represents deletion. Startup/lazy reads
  share the same critical section. Cache equality is asserted after operations
  settle, with failures leaving prior values intact.
- Provider authentication enumerates explicit OAuth/API-key and inferred default
  choices, two accounts, logout and a settings change. Resolved credentials are
  frozen together; logout does not recall an already captured outbound request.
- Download UI enumerates two pending requests, cancellation/manual retry,
  timer generations and effect replay. Each completion records the observable
  publication count before/after; stale completions cannot change it. A separate
  EventSubscriptionLifecycle covers recording listeners, pending registration,
  late cleanup, at-most-once unlisten and suppression of retired effects.
- Routing independently enumerates three polish/screen/search modes, two app
  overrides, four request modes and Yes/No/Unknown inputs.
- Parameter-independent ownership/version/first-match/consent/restoration and
  decision contracts have Lean proofs. Production correspondence is reviewed
  code plus tests, not an automatic source refinement theorem.

## What the gates mean

Inventory equality checks that no current registered boundary is omitted.
Reachability checks abstract actions; configured invariants/properties check
safety/progress under explicit bounds/fairness; negative controls check
sensitivity to removed guards. Source review/tests check correspondence. None
alone certifies every source branch or an external dependency.

Reachability is accepted only for the registry's explicit state-changing action
list. Properties must be configured assertions or positive named conjuncts of
assertions; negative/conditional mentions, comments and strings are rejected.
The verifier's own ten regression tests reproduced seven false passes before
this gate was tightened.

Read-only getters share a snapshot contract. Validation families share a
valid/invalid partition with concrete validator tests. Folder/browser/window/
clipboard/driver operations delegate to native primitives whose success/failure
are modeled inputs; pixel geometry and foreign-app consumption are reviewed/
tested outside mathematical state claims. Learned output contents are inputs,
not a proof of model accuracy. These are explicit exclusions, never counted as
proved. New boundaries or source changes require renewed correspondence review.
