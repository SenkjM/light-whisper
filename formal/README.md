# Application formal contracts

The application state model covers recording/capture/hotkeys, all four engine
classes, credentials/OAuth, providers/settings/personalization, context/routing,
selection/assistant, history, windows/subtitles, updates, theme/autostart and
bundled protocols.

[`verification.json`](verification.json) binds **123 registered commands**,
**16 event families**, **16 lifecycle entries** and **11 protocol families** to
obligations, model operators, source/test paths and explicit assumptions. CI
rejects inventory drift, missing anchors, unasserted properties, unreachable
explicitly declared actions, failed models/proofs and negative controls that no longer find the
expected counterexample. Registry membership is correspondence evidence, not
automatic proof of a Rust/TypeScript function.

## Verification layers

| Layer | What is established |
| --- | --- |
| Integrated AppWorkflow, ten workloads | Cross-subsystem safety: recording/output, consent/context/clipboard, download/configuration, assistant/selection, history/subtitles, updates and GPU suspension/reload. All declared actions must be reached across workloads. |
| Component TLA+ models | Deeper interleavings and validation/error partitions, with explicit finite bounds and conditional fairness for progress. |
| Lean StateContracts | Parameter-independent ownership/decision contracts, profile-version induction, first matching rule, consent, clipboard preservation, sample cap, correction provenance and theme. No sorry, admit or declared axiom. |
| Implementation correspondence | Actual regression tests and source-path review, including a source guard requiring provider/endpoint/key snapshots before OAuth awaits. This is not compiler refinement. |
| Negative controls | Legacy races and deliberate guard removals must fail with Java exit 12 and the named violated invariant. Required CI gates. |

## Model families

| Area | Models |
| --- | --- |
| Recording and capture | RecordingLifecycle, CapturePipeline, MicrophoneMonitor |
| Hotkeys | HotkeyLifecycle (three event-kind runs plus registration workload), HotkeyPendingStart, HotkeyRegistrationEpoch, HotkeyRegistrationFailure |
| Engines and migration | EngineDownload, RuntimeConfiguration, ModelDirectoryMigration |
| GPU residency and settings | GpuIdleLifecycle (startup and runtime enable), GpuIdleSettings |
| Authentication and provider pairing | OAuthLifecycle, OAuthStorage, ProviderRequests |
| Credential publication and account snapshots | WebSearchKeys, ProviderAuthSnapshot |
| Settings and personalization | ProfilePersistence, SettingsContracts, Personalization, AppProfileRules, AsyncSettings |
| Routing, tasks and history | ContextRouting, TaskOwnership, HistoryRecords |
| Windows and UI state | WindowLifecycle, UiPreferences |
| Download timers and event subscriptions | DownloadUiLifecycle, EventSubscriptionLifecycle |
| Protocols and transport | RequestProtocols, LlmTransport |

AppWorkflow is the additional integrated model. The registry is the authoritative
positive configuration/negative-control list. Operator names and concrete
source/test anchors are recorded per contract there.

## Reproduce

Use Python 3.10+, Java 21, official TLA+ tools **1.7.4** and Lean **4.34.1**.
Official binary downloads and SHA-256 digests are pinned in
[CI](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).
The stable TLC release avoids the automatically replaced `v1.8.0` prerelease
asset. SHA-256 verification remains mandatory. The runner keeps mutated modules
and their configs together for TLC 1.7.4 module resolution.

```sh
python scripts/check_formal.py --inventory-only
python scripts/check_formal.py --tlc-jar /path/to/tla2tools.jar \
  --lean /path/to/lean-4.34.1-linux/bin/lean --logs /path/to/formal-results
```

The runner saves per-configuration TLC logs, Lean output and a summary with
measured state counts/source hashes. See [delivery results](evidence/results.json),
[coverage boundaries](COVERAGE.md) and [implementation evidence](evidence/source-contracts.md).

The binding gate treats actions and properties separately. Only named actions
with state updates may use execution coverage. Every mapped safety/liveness
property must be an actual configured INVARIANT/PROPERTY, or a positive conjunct
of one. References inside negation, implication, comments or strings never count
as checking that property. Ten verifier regressions exercise this distinction.

## Proof boundary

This verifies application **state/protocol contracts**, not every instruction
of compiled Rust/TypeScript/Python, unrestricted Cartesian-product combinations,
or Windows/Tauri/CPAL/WASAPI/keyring/SQLite/browser/network implementations.
Native primitives supply success/failure inputs; concrete parser/URL/length
partitions have implementation tests. Pixel layout, accessibility, floating
point signal conversion and ASR/LLM linguistic quality are not mathematical
claims of this state model; implementation tests remain required.

Lean proves the listed abstract contracts without finite bounds, but does not
provide a verified compiler/source-equivalence bridge. Progress requires stated
scheduler/timeouts/I/O assumptions; generation counters must not wrap.
OAuthLifecycle.MemoryMatchesDisk describes successful atomic publication;
physical partial failures are separately modeled in OAuthStorage. Committed
atomic writes are assumed durable under normal restart. If all marker/deletion
writes fail, logout clears current-process memory and returns an error; impossible
storage writes cannot ensure durable logout across restart.
