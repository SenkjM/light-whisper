# HistoryRecords formal evidence

## Scope and source baseline

- Repository baseline: `d29cd45db8876bd7bcfa915ae642af3b0fcc4bbe`.
- Owned artifacts: `formal/HistoryRecords.tla`, `formal/HistoryRecords.cfg`, and this file.
- The model is test-only. No production file was changed by this slice; the existing working-tree changes in other slices were left untouched.
- TLC runtime: `/mnt/c/Users/sun/AppData/Local/Temp/light-whisper-tla2tools-1.8.0.jar`, invoked through WSL with four workers, unique `/tmp` metadirs, and `-noGenerateSpecTE`.

## Requirement and source mapping

| Behavior | Source mapping | Model mapping |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared audio identities and reference counting | `src-tauri/src/services/history_service.rs:188-281` defines the history and `history_audio_leases` tables. The initial fixture has rows 1 and 2 sharing `A`, and rows 3 and 4 sharing `B` (`formal/HistoryRecords.tla:33-109`). | `References`, `ReferencedOrLeasedAudioRetained` (`formal/HistoryRecords.tla:17-25`, `538-541`) require every referenced or leased file to remain present. |
| Atomic reprocess read plus lease | `history_service.rs:446-494` uses an `IMMEDIATE` transaction to read the row, upsert the lease, and commit. | `AcquireReprocess` (`153-182`) updates the snapshot and lease in one action. `ReprocessLeaseProtectsSnapshot` and `DeletedSourceStillLeased` (`552-562`) observe the protection while the source row can be deleted. |
| Delete and retention transactions | `history_service.rs:742-775` deletes the row in an `IMMEDIATE` transaction; `777-823` selects distinct audio identities, deletes expired rows, commits, then performs post-commit GC. | `BeginDelete`/`CommitDelete` and `BeginRetention`/`CommitRetention` (`306-395`) separate transaction state from post-commit GC. `DeleteTransactionIsAtomic` (`546-550`) observes the transaction boundary. A `retentionDays = 0` guard matches the source early return. |
| GC safety and query failures | `history_service.rs:687-718` checks row references and lease counts; query or filesystem failure retains the file. | `GC`/`GCQueryFailure` (`399-420`) and `ReferencedOrLeasedAudioRetained`/`GCFaultRetainsAudio` (`538-544`) model both safety paths. |
| Reprocess from a snapshot after source deletion | `src-tauri/src/commands/history.rs:156-262` reprocesses the captured row and inserts a new record with `reprocessed_from_id`; `264-293` releases the lease on both success and failure. | `AcquireReprocess`, `InsertReprocessed`, and `ReleaseReprocessLease` (`153-302`) keep the captured audio/text/origin values independent of later row deletion. `ReprocessedRowsUseSnapshot` (`564-568`) checks the inserted row. |
| Read, export, and workflow failures | `history_service.rs:319-325` reads saved audio; `commands/history.rs:93-146` covers export, saved-audio read, and result failures; `148-154` rejects assistant/edit workflows. | `AcquireQueryFailure`, `AcquireMissing`, `RejectNonDictation`, `ReadAudioSuccess`, `ReadAudioFailure`, and `ReadAudioMissing` (`185-253`) preserve failure states and leases. `BeginExport` plus success/failure/cancel (`422-439`) models the export branches. |
| Saving consent gate | `services/audio_service/finalize.rs:59-143,256-324` persists history only when enabled and schedules audio saving only when `history_enabled && save_audio`; `commands/profile.rs:208-228` stores `save_audio` as `enabled && save_audio`; defaults are in `state/user_profile.rs:181-200`. | `SetHistorySettings` and `PersistRecord` (`112-150`) enforce `saveAudioEffective = historyEnabled /\ requestedSaveAudio`; `SaveAudioGate` and `PersistedAudioHasConsent` (`531-536`) observe the gate. |

The fixture deliberately includes two records per each of two audio identities. It also reaches a no-audio persisted row, an assistant row rejected for ordinary reprocessing, a deleted source with an active lease, successful and failed audio reads, retention query failure, GC query failure, and all export terminal states.

## TLC positive result

Committed `formal/HistoryRecords.cfg` checks `FairSpec`, all nine state invariants, and `CleanupEventually`. `FairSpec` adds weak fairness only to successful `GC(audio)` actions; `CleanupEventually` is conditional on a candidate remaining unreferenced, unleased, and outside a transaction (`formal/HistoryRecords.tla:471-486`).

Exact safety/liveness command:

```text
wsl.exe bash -lc 'set -o pipefail; java -XX:+UseParallelGC -jar /mnt/c/Users/sun/AppData/Local/Temp/light-whisper-tla2tools-1.8.0.jar -workers 4 -noGenerateSpecTE -metadir /tmp/light-whisper-history-safety-$(date +%s%N) -config /mnt/c/Users/sun/Downloads/light-whisper/formal/HistoryRecords.cfg /mnt/c/Users/sun/Downloads/light-whisper/formal/HistoryRecords.tla'
```

Result on 2026-09-28:

```text
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
2004619 states generated, 414760 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 16.
Implied-temporal checking--satisfiability problem has 3 branches.
```

The `-coverage 1` replay also completed with no error and the same 2,004,619 / 414,760 / depth-16 totals. Nonzero coverage was observed for `AcquireReprocess`, `ReadAudioSuccess`, `ReadAudioFailure`, `ReadAudioMissing`, `InsertReprocessed`, `BeginDelete`, `CommitDelete`, `BeginRetention`, `RetentionQueryFailure`, `GC`, `GCQueryFailure`, `BeginExport`, `ExportSuccess`, `ExportFailure`, and `ExportCancelled`.

## Intentional negative mutation

In a temporary directory outside the repository, I copied the model and replaced the GC reference guard

```tla
/\ ~References(state, audio)
```

with

```tla
/\ TRUE \* MUTATION: reference-count guard removed
```

The corrected mutation was run from `C:\Users\sun\AppData\Local\Temp\light-whisper-history-negative-ce60923edeab4ec1abee32fb4ed7e071` with the same TLC jar, workers, `-noGenerateSpecTE`, and a unique `/tmp/light-whisper-history-negative-*` metadir. TLC produced a semantic RED:

```text
Error: Invariant ReferencedOrLeasedAudioRetained is violated.
State 3: <BeginDelete(1)>
State 4: <CommitDelete>
State 5: <GC("A")>
```

The smallest counterexample deletes row 1 while row 2 still references `A`, then the mutated GC removes `A`; state 5 has `records = {2, 3, 4}`, `gcCandidates = {}`, and `audioPresent[A] = FALSE`. The failing invariant is therefore the intended reference/lease retention observer, rather than a parser, type, or fixture failure.

## Existing source tests read

`history_service.rs` contains `latency_percentiles_are_stable` (857), `audio_paths_reject_traversal` (864), `sqlite_schema_round_trips_and_cleans_expired_history` (871), `audio_lease_survives_source_row_deletion_until_reprocess_finishes` (925), and `legacy_schema_migrates_assistant_workflow` (972). `commands/history.rs` contains `only_plain_dictation_history_can_be_reprocessed` (325) and `edit_export_keeps_instruction_source_and_actual_model_separate` (332). These source tests were used for mapping; this slice adds no Rust test code.

## Trusted assumptions and limits

- Bounds are intentionally finite: `MaxRecords = 5`, `MaxLeaseCount = 1`, and `MaxRetentionDays = 1`; the model allows one settings update, one delete attempt, one retention attempt, one reprocess read, and one export run. This is exhaustive only for that bounded abstraction.
- SQLite `IMMEDIATE` transactions, commit/rollback outcomes, filesystem presence, and query/read/write failures are abstract state transitions. The model does not prove rusqlite, WAL, OS filesystem, audio bytes, ASR, LLM, UI dialogs, or scheduler implementation details.
- The model captures the enabled/save-audio consent gate and the retention-day-zero behavior. It abstracts the exact profile command ordering around `cleanup(retention_days)` and persistence, and it does not model app-profile resolution or startup orphan scanning beyond the relevant retained-file condition.
- Existing production source semantics were preserved in the model; no production fix is proposed by this slice. The formal result is bounded evidence, not an implementation proof.
